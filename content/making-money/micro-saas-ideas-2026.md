Micro-SaaS is the indie developer's dream: small software products that solve specific problems for niche audiences. Recurring revenue. No venture capital needed. Often run by one person.

AI has made building micro-SaaS dramatically faster. What used to take 6 months of development can now be done in weeks. The ideas that follow aren't theoretical - they're based on real market gaps and validated demand.

## What Makes a Good Micro-SaaS Idea

Before the list, let's establish criteria:

**Clear problem:** The target user has a specific, recurring pain point
**Willingness to pay:** They're already paying for solutions (or clearly would)
**Reachable audience:** You can find and market to these people
**Buildable with AI:** Modern tools can help you ship quickly
**Defensible moat:** Some barrier to trivial copying (niche expertise, network effects, integrations)

Ideas that hit all five criteria are gold. Most hit 3-4.

## The Ideas

### 1. AI Meeting Notes for Specific Industries

**The problem:** Otter.ai and Fireflies are general-purpose. Industry-specific meeting notes need domain vocabulary, specific formatting, and relevant action items.

**The opportunity:** Build meeting transcription and summarization for a specific vertical: real estate agents, therapists, lawyers, medical professionals.

**Why it works:** Professionals pay $50-200/month for tools that save them time. A real estate agent who gets automated listing notes from buyer calls would absolutely pay.

**Build approach:** Use Whisper API for transcription, Claude or GPT for summarization with industry-specific prompts, simple web interface.

**Market validation:** Search "[industry] meeting notes tool" - if results are generic, there's an opportunity.

**Revenue potential:** $10K-50K MRR with 200-500 paying customers at $50-100/month.

### 2. Content Repurposing Pipeline

**The problem:** Creators have long-form content (podcasts, YouTube videos, blogs) that could become dozens of social posts. Manual repurposing is tedious.

**The opportunity:** Tool that takes one piece of content and generates multiple posts for different platforms, formatted correctly for each.

**Why it works:** Creators are overwhelmed. Tools that multiply their output without multiplying their time are valuable.

**Build approach:** Input accepts URLs or text. AI extracts key points, generates platform-specific content (Twitter threads, LinkedIn posts, Instagram captions, etc.).

**Market validation:** #ContentRepurposing has millions of posts. People are actively searching for solutions.

**Revenue potential:** $5K-30K MRR. Freemium with $19-49/month premium.

### 3. Customer Feedback Analyzer

**The problem:** Companies collect customer feedback from multiple channels (surveys, reviews, support tickets, social media). Synthesizing insights manually is impossible at scale.

**The opportunity:** Tool that aggregates feedback from multiple sources, categorizes themes, identifies trends, and surfaces actionable insights.

**Why it works:** Customer-centric companies pay for tools that help them understand their customers better.

**Build approach:** Integrations with common feedback sources (Intercom, Zendesk, Google Reviews, etc.). AI categorization and analysis. Dashboard with trends.

**Market validation:** Enterprise solutions exist but are expensive. SMB market is underserved.

**Revenue potential:** $10K-100K MRR depending on market positioning.

### 4. AI-Powered Competitive Intelligence

**The problem:** Tracking competitors manually is time-consuming. Most companies do it sporadically instead of systematically.

**The opportunity:** Automated tracking of competitor websites, social media, pricing changes, product updates, and news mentions. Weekly digest with AI analysis.

**Why it works:** Every business cares about competition but few have resources to monitor systematically.

**Build approach:** Web scraping for competitor sites, social media APIs, news monitoring. AI summarizes changes and implications.

**Market validation:** Tools like Crayon exist but cost $20K+/year. Huge gap for SMB version at $99-299/month.

**Revenue potential:** $20K-100K MRR targeting SMB market.

### 5. Cold Email Personalization Tool

**The problem:** Generic cold emails get ignored. Personalized emails work but take time to research and write for each prospect.

**The opportunity:** Tool that researches prospects (LinkedIn, company website, news) and generates personalized email copy at scale.

**Why it works:** Sales teams send thousands of cold emails. Even small improvements in response rate have huge impact.

**Build approach:** Scrape public info about prospects, use AI to generate personalized elements, integrate with email tools.

**Market validation:** SDRs actively discuss this problem. Existing solutions are either expensive or low quality.

**Revenue potential:** $10K-50K MRR. Sales teams pay well for tools that work.

### 6. Niche Job Board with AI Matching

**The problem:** General job boards are noisy. Niche professionals struggle to find relevant opportunities, and employers struggle to find qualified candidates.

**The opportunity:** Job board for a specific niche (AI engineers, fractional executives, climate tech, etc.) with AI-powered matching and qualification.

**Why it works:** Job boards have proven business models. Niche focus creates stickiness.

**Build approach:** Standard job board functionality plus AI matching algorithm. Candidates describe skills, jobs describe requirements, AI scores fit.

**Market validation:** Pick a growing niche. If relevant subreddits have "hiring" threads, there's demand.

**Revenue potential:** $5K-100K MRR depending on niche. Revenue from job postings ($99-499/each) and/or premium candidate features.

### 7. SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) Generator

**The problem:** Every company needs documented processes. Writing SOPs is boring and time-consuming. Most companies have tribal knowledge instead of documentation.

**The opportunity:** Tool that helps create, maintain, and share SOPs. AI assists with writing, formatting, and suggesting improvements.

**Why it works:** Companies trying to scale or get acquired need documentation. The pain is real.

**Build approach:** Template library, AI writing assistance, version control, team sharing. Maybe video/screen recording integration.

**Market validation:** "How to write SOPs" gets significant search volume. Operations managers constantly discuss this.

**Revenue potential:** $5K-30K MRR. Per-seat pricing for teams.

### 8. AI Legal Document Generator for Specific Use Cases

**The problem:** Lawyers are expensive. Template services like LegalZoom are generic. Specific document types need specialized solutions.

**The opportunity:** Focus on one document type: NDAs, freelance contracts, licensing agreements, partnership agreements. Deep, specific, excellent.

**Why it works:** Businesses need legal documents constantly. Saving lawyer fees has obvious ROI.

**Build approach:** Work with a lawyer to create AI-powered generation for one document type. Built-in compliance and customization.

**Market validation:** Look at how many times specific contract templates are downloaded. High volume = high demand.

**Revenue potential:** $5K-50K MRR. Per-document pricing or subscription.

### 9. Email Newsletter Analytics Platform

**The problem:** Substack and Beehiiv give basic analytics. Serious newsletter operators want deeper insights: subscriber engagement scoring, churn prediction, content performance analysis.

**The opportunity:** Analytics platform that integrates with newsletter tools and provides advanced AI-powered insights.

**Why it works:** Newsletters are businesses. Operators will pay for tools that help them grow and retain subscribers.

**Build approach:** API integrations with major newsletter platforms. AI analysis of open/click patterns. Actionable recommendations.

**Market validation:** Newsletter Twitter is constantly discussing analytics and optimization.

**Revenue potential:** $5K-50K MRR. Scales with subscriber count of customers.

### 10. Proposal Generator for Service Businesses

**The problem:** Agencies and consultants write proposals constantly. Each one takes hours. Many lose deals because they're too slow.

**The opportunity:** Tool that generates customized proposals based on client brief, past proposals, and service offerings.

**Why it works:** Faster proposals = more proposals sent = more deals won. Clear ROI.

**Build approach:** Template system plus AI customization. Client brief input, AI-generated proposal output. CRM integration for tracking.

**Market validation:** Agency owners constantly discuss proposal efficiency. Existing tools are outdated.

**Revenue potential:** $10K-50K MRR. Agencies pay well for efficiency tools.

### 11. AI-Powered Review Response Tool

**The problem:** Businesses get reviews on Google, Yelp, Facebook, industry sites. Responding appropriately takes time. Many don't respond at all.

**The opportunity:** Tool that aggregates reviews from all platforms and generates appropriate, brand-consistent responses.

**Why it works:** Responding to reviews improves ratings and shows customers the business cares. Time is the bottleneck.

**Build approach:** API integrations with review platforms. AI generates responses based on review sentiment and company voice guidelines.

**Market validation:** Local businesses and multi-location companies actively search for review management solutions.

**Revenue potential:** $10K-100K MRR. Works well for agencies managing multiple businesses.

### 12. Course Platform with AI Teaching Assistant

**The problem:** Course creators want to provide support but can't scale Q&A. Students drop out because they get stuck without help.

**The opportunity:** Course hosting platform where AI serves as teaching assistant - answering questions, providing feedback, guiding students.

**Why it works:** Better student outcomes = better course reviews = more sales. Creators would pay for this leverage.

**Build approach:** Basic course hosting plus AI trained on course content. Students can ask questions, AI provides contextual help.

**Market validation:** Course creators constantly discuss support scalability as a bottleneck.

**Revenue potential:** $10K-50K MRR. Percentage of course revenue or flat monthly fee.

### 13. Changelog and Release Notes Generator

**The problem:** Software companies need to communicate updates. Writing changelogs is tedious. Many skip it, hurting user communication.

**The opportunity:** Tool that connects to git/project management and generates user-friendly release notes automatically.

**Why it works:** Developers hate writing changelogs but know they should. Automation solves the motivation problem.

**Build approach:** GitHub/GitLab integration, Jira/Linear integration. AI transforms technical commits into user-friendly language.

**Market validation:** #BuildInPublic community constantly discusses this. Tools exist but aren't AI-native.

**Revenue potential:** $5K-20K MRR. Per-repo or per-seat pricing.

### 14. Social Proof Widget Platform

**The problem:** Websites need social proof (reviews, activity, testimonials) but integrating and displaying it is fragmented.

**The opportunity:** Widget platform that aggregates social proof from multiple sources and displays it beautifully on any website.

**Why it works:** Social proof increases conversion. Easy implementation reduces friction.

**Build approach:** Widgets that embed on any site. Aggregate from Google, Trustpilot, Twitter, etc. AI selects and displays best proof.

**Market validation:** Existing tools like Proof and Fomo have proven the market. Room for AI-enhanced version.

**Revenue potential:** $10K-50K MRR. Tiered by website traffic or features.

### 15. AI Writing Style Analyzer and Enforcer

**The problem:** Teams want consistent brand voice across all content. Style guides exist but aren't enforced. Results are inconsistent.

**The opportunity:** Tool that learns a brand's writing style and checks/suggests edits for all content to match.

**Why it works:** Brand consistency matters to marketing teams. Manual enforcement doesn't scale.

**Build approach:** Train on company's existing content to learn style. Analyze new content and suggest edits. Could be plugin for Google Docs, Notion, etc.

**Market validation:** Enterprise solutions exist but are expensive. SMB market has few options.

**Revenue potential:** $5K-30K MRR. Per-seat pricing for teams.

## Validating Before Building

Don't build any of these without validation first:

**Step 1: Search validation**
- Are people searching for solutions? (Google Trends, keyword research)
- What are they finding? (Current solutions, gaps)

**Step 2: Community validation**
- Talk to 10-20 potential users
- Understand their current process and pain
- Ask what they've tried and why it didn't work

**Step 3: Competitive validation**
- Who else is solving this?
- What do users complain about with existing solutions?
- What's your angle?

**Step 4: Willingness to pay**
- Ask potential users what they'd pay
- Better: see what they're already paying for adjacent solutions

## Picking Your Idea

Choose based on:

**Your expertise:** Ideas in industries you understand have higher success rates

**Your network:** Can you reach 100 potential customers without ads?

**Your interest:** You'll be working on this for years. Pick something you care about.

**Market timing:** Some ideas are too early, some too late. Look for growing trends.

**Technical fit:** Can you build an MVP in 30-60 days with AI assistance?

The best idea is worthless if you don't execute. Pick one that matches your skills and situation, then commit to building it.

Micro-SaaS rewards persistence over brilliance. The ideas above are starting points. Your execution, iteration, and customer focus determine the outcome.
