Notion templates are one of the easiest digital products to create and sell. Some creators are making $5K-50K per month selling templates they built in a weekend.

The barrier to entry is low. The market is growing. And if you're already a Notion user, you have a head start.

Here's the complete guide to building a Notion template business.

## Why Notion Templates Sell

**Notion is massive and growing.** Millions of users, and most don't want to build systems from scratch. They'll pay for a head start.

**Templates solve real problems.** A good template saves hours of setup time and delivers a proven system. Clear value proposition.

**Zero marginal cost.** Create once, sell unlimited times. Pure profit after creation.

**Low competition relative to market size.** Compared to other digital products, Notion templates are still relatively uncrowded.

**Multiple sales channels.** Gumroad, Notion's marketplace, your own site, social media - multiple ways to reach customers.

## Creating Your First Template

### Step 1: Find a Validated Idea

Don't build what you think is cool. Build what people want to buy.

**Research methods:**

**Study existing templates:** Look at Gumroad, Notion template marketplaces, and Etsy. What has reviews? What sells well? What are people requesting?

**Check communities:** Reddit's r/Notion, Notion Facebook groups, Twitter. What problems do people ask about? What templates do they wish existed?

**Analyze your own Notion:** What systems have you built that others might want? Your solutions to your problems often solve others' problems too.

**Keyword research:** What Notion-related terms are people searching for? "Notion budget template," "Notion CRM template," etc.

### Step 2: Design for Usability

A beautiful template that's hard to use won't get good reviews. Prioritize usability.

**Design principles:**

**Start simple:** Begin with core functionality. Add features based on demand.

**Clear navigation:** Users should understand the structure immediately. Use consistent naming and organization.

**Instructions included:** Create a "Getting Started" page that explains how to use everything.

**Mobile-friendly:** Many users access Notion on mobile. Test your templates on different devices.

**Flexible structure:** Users will customize. Make it easy for them to adapt your template to their needs.

### Step 3: Polish the Presentation

First impressions matter. Make your template look professional.

**Visual polish:**
- Consistent color scheme (Notion's built-in colors work fine)
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Strategic use of icons (don't overdo it)
- Good use of dividers and spacing

**Cover images:** Create attractive covers for each database and main page. Canva works well for this.

**Demo content:** Pre-populate with realistic sample data so buyers can see how it works before they clear it out.

### Step 4: Create Supporting Materials

The template itself is only part of the product.

**Must-have additions:**

**Setup guide:** Step-by-step instructions, ideally with screenshots or video

**Template walkthrough video:** 5-10 minute video showing how everything works. Reduces support requests and increases perceived value.

**FAQ section:** Anticipate common questions and answer them upfront.

**Nice-to-have additions:**

- Use case examples
- Customization suggestions
- Community access
- Future update promises

## Pricing Your Templates

Pricing is where most creators leave money on the table. They price too low.

### The Pricing Framework

Consider these factors:

**Time saved:** If your template saves 10 hours of setup, and your buyer's time is worth $50/hour, the template creates $500 of value. Charging $50-100 is reasonable.

**Problem solved:** Templates that solve painful problems command higher prices than nice-to-have organization tools.

**Target audience:** Businesses and professionals pay more than college students. Know who you're selling to.

**Competitive landscape:** What do similar templates cost? You can be higher if quality justifies it.

### Pricing Tiers That Work

**Entry tier ($9-29):**
- Simple, single-purpose templates
- Minimal support
- Good for building initial sales and reviews

**Standard tier ($29-79):**
- Comprehensive systems
- Video walkthrough included
- Email support

**Premium tier ($79-199):**
- Complete solutions with multiple integrated templates
- Video tutorials
- Community access
- Update guarantees
- Direct support

### Bundles and Upsells

Increase average order value:

**Template bundles:** Package related templates together at a discount. The "Productivity Bundle" at $79 instead of $120 if bought separately.

**Upsells:** After purchase, offer related products at a discount.

**Updates:** Sell "lifetime updates" access for premium versions.
