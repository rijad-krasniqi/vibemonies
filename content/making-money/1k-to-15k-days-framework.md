For months, I was stuck at $1K days. Some days a bit more, some days less. Never that breakout moment.

Then I learned something that changed everything: the problem wasn't my product or my offer. It was my understanding of who I was actually talking to.

Six months later, $15K days became normal. Here's the framework that made it happen.

## Step 1: Understand the Awareness Layers

Every potential customer exists somewhere on an awareness spectrum. Where they are determines how you should talk to them.

The five levels:

**1. Unaware** - They don't even know they have a problem. They're living their life, not searching for solutions.

**2. Problem Aware** - They know something's wrong but don't know what to do about it. "My ads aren't converting but I don't know why."

**3. Solution Aware** - They know solutions exist but don't know which one is right. "I know I need better landing pages but there are a hundred options."

**4. Product Aware** - They know your product exists but aren't sure if it's for them. "I've heard of this but is it worth the money?"

**5. Most Aware** - They know your product and just need a reason to buy now. "I've been meaning to get this, what's the deal?"

Most people market to everyone the same way. That's why they stay stuck.

## Step 2: Run a Market Search

Look at what your competitors are doing. Not to copy them, but to find the gaps.

What to look for:

- Which awareness levels are they targeting?
- What messaging angles are they using?
- Where are they spending their ad dollars?
- What's getting engagement vs. what's getting ignored?

You'll usually find that everyone clusters around one or two awareness levels. Problem aware and product aware are the most crowded.

The opportunity is in the levels everyone ignores.

## Step 3: Identify the Highest Leverage Stage

Here's the counterintuitive part: the most crowded stages aren't always the best.

If everyone's competing for problem-aware customers, costs are high and attention is scarce. But unaware customers? Solution-aware? Often cheaper to reach and convert.

Do the math:

- What does it cost to reach 1,000 people at each awareness level?
- What's the conversion rate at each level?
- What's the actual cost per customer?

Sometimes a "harder to convert" audience is actually cheaper because there's no competition.

## Step 4: Create Stage-Specific Content

Once you know which stage you're targeting, create content specifically for them.

**For Unaware:** Educational content that plants a seed. "5 signs your business is leaving money on the table." You're not selling, you're creating awareness of a problem they didn't know they had.

**For Problem Aware:** Diagnosis content. "Why your ads aren't converting (and what actually fixes it)." You're positioning yourself as someone who understands their pain.

**For Solution Aware:** Comparison and positioning. "The three approaches to fixing your conversion rate and which one works best for your situation." You're helping them navigate options.

**For Product Aware:** Case studies and proof. "How Company X went from 2% to 8% conversion in 30 days." You're showing them your product works.

**For Most Aware:** Offers and urgency. "Get 40% off this week only." They already want it, you're just giving them a reason to act now.

## Step 5: Build Ladders Between Stages

The real magic happens when you connect the stages together.

Someone who's unaware today could be most aware in two weeks. But only if you build the path.

What this looks like:

- Unaware person sees your educational content
- They realize they have a problem (now problem aware)
- They sign up for your email list to learn more
- Your emails teach them about solutions (now solution aware)
- They see your product mentioned as one option (now product aware)
- They get testimonials and case studies
- They get an offer and buy (most aware -> customer)

Each piece of content should naturally lead to the next stage. Don't try to jump people from unaware to buying in one step.

## Step 6: Scale What's Working

Once you have the machine running, scale is straightforward.

Track everything:

- Cost per person at each awareness stage
- Conversion rate between stages
- Time from first touch to purchase
- Lifetime value of customers from each entry point

You'll find that certain paths work way better than others. Maybe unaware TikTok viewers convert at 0.5% but solution-aware Google searchers convert at 5%.

Put more money into what works. Cut what doesn't. Repeat.

## Why This Works When Nothing Else Did

Before I understood this, I was running ads that assumed everyone knew about my product and just needed a discount.

I was speaking to most-aware people. But most people who saw my ads weren't most aware. They didn't even know my product existed.

My messaging was mismatched to my audience. No wonder it didn't convert.

When I started creating content for each stage and building the ladder, everything changed:

- My cost per lead dropped because I wasn't trying to close people who weren't ready
- My conversion rate increased because people arrived at my offer already educated
- My customer quality improved because they understood what they were buying
- My refund rate dropped because expectations were set correctly

The framework doesn't just increase revenue. It fixes the whole business.

## The Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Only targeting most-aware customers**

These are the easiest to convert but there aren't many of them. You're fighting for scraps with everyone else.

**Mistake 2: Trying to convert unaware customers immediately**

The opposite mistake. You can't sell to someone who doesn't know they have a problem. You need to educate first.

**Mistake 3: Using the same message everywhere**

Your Facebook ad shouldn't sound like your sales page. Different stages need different messages.

**Mistake 4: Not tracking stage progression**

If you don't know how people move through stages, you can't optimize the journey.

## What $15K Days Actually Look Like

At $15K/day, you're typically:

- Spending $3-5K on ads across multiple awareness stages
- Converting at 2-5x the industry average because your targeting is precise
- Building an email list of people in various stages who buy over time
- Creating content that works organically AND as paid ads
- Constantly testing new entry points and messaging

It's not about one viral campaign. It's about a system that reliably converts attention into revenue.

## Start Here

If you're stuck at lower revenue and want to break through:

**This week:** Map out the five awareness stages for your specific product. Where do most of your customers come from? Where are the gaps?

**Next week:** Create one piece of content for each stage you're currently ignoring. Test them.

**This month:** Build an email sequence that moves people from problem aware to most aware over 7-14 days.

The framework works. But only if you implement it.

$1K days to $15K days isn't about working harder. It's about working smarter. Understanding who you're talking to. Meeting them where they are.

Do that consistently and the numbers take care of themselves.
