Metaculus and Polymarket both call themselves prediction platforms. But comparing them is like comparing a chess club to a poker room. Same general concept. Completely different games.

One runs on reputation. The other runs on money.

One attracts academics and policy wonks. The other attracts traders and crypto natives.

Understanding the difference matters because choosing the wrong platform for your goals wastes your time. Let me break down exactly what each platform does and who should use it.

## The Fundamental Difference

**Metaculus** is a forecasting platform. You make predictions using points, not money. Your goal is building a reputation as an accurate forecaster. No money changes hands.

**Polymarket** is a prediction market. You trade with real money (USDC). Your goal is making profitable trades. You can win or lose actual cash.

This single difference shapes everything else about these platforms.

## How Metaculus Works

On Metaculus, you answer questions by predicting probabilities. "What's the chance AI achieves X by 2030?" You slide a bar to 37%. Someone else says 52%. The community median forms.

When the event resolves, you get scored based on how accurate you were. Good predictions boost your ranking. Bad ones hurt it.

There's no trading. No buying or selling positions. No cashing out. Just pure forecasting.

The currency is reputation. Top forecasters get recognized. Some get invited to contribute to policy discussions or research projects. Metaculus has partnerships with organizations that actually use these forecasts for decision-making.

## How Polymarket Works

On Polymarket, you buy and sell shares in outcomes. "Will X happen by March?" trades at 45 cents. If you think it'll happen, you buy Yes shares. If it happens, each share pays out $1. If not, they're worth nothing.

You can also sell before resolution. If you bought at 45 cents and the price moves to 65 cents, you can sell for profit without waiting for the outcome.

Real money. Real profits. Real losses.

The currency is USDC (a stablecoin). You deposit crypto, trade, and withdraw your winnings.

## Who Uses Each Platform

**Metaculus attracts:**

- Academic researchers and scientists
- Policy analysts and think tank researchers
- AI safety community members
- People who care about being right more than making money
- Long-term forecasters (questions can span decades)

**Polymarket attracts:**

- Traders looking for alpha
- Crypto natives comfortable with on-chain transactions
- News junkies who want to profit from their knowledge
- Sports and politics bettors
- Short to medium-term speculators

There's some overlap. But the core audiences are different.

## Question Types and Timeframes

**Metaculus**

Metaculus specializes in long-range forecasting. Questions like:

- When will we achieve artificial general intelligence?
- What will global temperatures be in 2050?
- Will humans land on Mars by 2035?

Many questions don't resolve for years or decades. This is by design. The platform is built for forecasting that matters for policy and planning.

Questions are often complex with detailed resolution criteria. The community debates edge cases. Moderators clarify ambiguities.

**Polymarket**

Polymarket focuses on near-term events. Questions like:

- Who will win this week's election?
- Will the Fed raise rates this month?
- Will this celebrity announcement happen by Friday?

Most markets resolve within days, weeks, or months. A few extend to a year or two. But nothing spanning decades.

Markets open fast when news breaks. If something's trending, there's probably already a market for it.

## The Liquidity Question

On Polymarket, liquidity is everything. Can you get your money in and out at reasonable prices? Are the spreads tight enough to trade profitably?

Metaculus doesn't have this problem because there's no money. Everyone can participate in every question regardless of how many others are predicting.

But Polymarket liquidity varies wildly. Major political markets might have millions in volume. Some niche market nobody cares about might have $500 total.

If you're trading Polymarket, you need to pay attention to liquidity. If you're forecasting on Metaculus, it's irrelevant.

## Accuracy and Information Quality

Here's something interesting: both platforms have good track records, but they get there differently.

**Metaculus accuracy** comes from aggregating many informed forecasters. The community skews expert. When you're forecasting AI developments and half your users are AI researchers, you get better forecasts.

**Polymarket accuracy** comes from money on the line. When people can profit from being right, they work harder to be right. The "wisdom of crowds" effect gets amplified by financial incentives.

Studies suggest real-money prediction markets slightly outperform non-monetary forecasting platforms. But the difference isn't huge. Both beat pundits and polls.

## Making Money vs. Building Reputation

This is the core trade-off.

**Choose Metaculus if:**

- You care more about being recognized as accurate than making money
- You want to forecast long-term questions that matter
- You enjoy the intellectual challenge of forecasting
- You don't want to deal with crypto or financial risk
- You're interested in policy-relevant questions

**Choose Polymarket if:**

- You want to profit from your predictions
- You're comfortable with financial risk
- You prefer short-term markets that resolve quickly
- You already use crypto or are willing to learn
- You want to trade actively, not just predict passively

## Can You Use Both?

Absolutely. Many serious forecasters do.

Use Metaculus for long-term questions where you can't bet anyway. Build your track record. Engage with the forecasting community. Improve your calibration.

Use Polymarket to monetize short-term edges. When you have conviction on something that resolves soon, put money on it.

The skills transfer. Good forecasting on Metaculus makes you better at Polymarket. Profitable trading on Polymarket sharpens your probability estimates.

## The Skill Development Angle

If you're new to prediction markets, Metaculus is actually a great training ground.

No financial risk means you can practice freely. Make bold predictions. See where you're wrong. Learn to calibrate without losing money.

Metaculus also has community features, discussion threads, and resolved questions you can analyze. It's built for learning.

Once you're calibrated, move to Polymarket with real money. You'll make better decisions because you practiced without stakes first.

## Platform Stability and Trust

**Metaculus** has been around since 2015. It's a stable, well-run nonprofit focused on improving forecasting. Not going anywhere.

**Polymarket** has had a rockier history. It settled with the CFTC in 2022 and left the US market. Now it's back with proper approval. It's more established than before but still a crypto platform with crypto platform risks.

If you're putting serious money on Polymarket, understand that platform risk exists. Don't keep more on the platform than you're willing to lose to a black swan event.

## Getting Started on Each

**Metaculus:**

1. Create a free account
2. Browse questions in your areas of expertise
3. Start making predictions
4. Read community discussions to improve
5. Track your Brier score over time

**Polymarket:**

1. Set up a crypto wallet (MetaMask works)
2. Get USDC on Polygon network
3. Connect wallet to Polymarket
4. Start with small positions ($50-100)
5. Learn how trading works before sizing up

## The Hybrid Strategy

Here's what I recommend for people serious about prediction:

Start on Metaculus. Spend a few months making predictions. Get calibrated. Understand where your knowledge edges are.

Then open a Polymarket account. When you see markets in your areas of expertise, check if the prices match your Metaculus-trained intuition. If there's a gap, trade it.

Use Metaculus for questions you care about intellectually. Use Polymarket for questions you can profit from.

The platforms aren't competitors. They're complements.
