Made money on Polymarket or Kalshi? Congrats. Now the fun part: figuring out taxes.

Prediction market taxation is still a gray area in many ways, but here's what we know and how to stay on the right side of the IRS.

## The Basic Rules

Prediction market profits are generally taxable as either capital gains or ordinary income. The classification depends on how you trade and how the IRS views your activity.

**For most retail traders:** Profits are treated as short-term capital gains (taxed at your ordinary income rate) if positions are held less than a year.

**For frequent traders:** If trading is your primary activity, you might be classified as a trader for tax purposes, which has different implications.

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Kalshi:** As a CFTC-regulated exchange, Kalshi provides 1099 forms for US users. You'll receive documentation of your trading activity, making reporting straightforward.

**Polymarket:** Crypto-based platform. You're responsible for tracking your own activity. Tools like Koinly or CoinTracker can help calculate gains and losses from on-chain activity.

## What to Track

Keep records of:

- Every trade (buy/sell date, amounts, prices)
- Deposits and withdrawals
- Platform fees paid
- Wallet addresses used

Good record-keeping now saves pain at tax time.

## Losses Are Valuable

Lost money trading? Those losses can offset gains. You can deduct up to $3,000 in net capital losses against ordinary income per year, carrying forward excess losses to future years.
