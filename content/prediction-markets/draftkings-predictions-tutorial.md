DraftKings just entered prediction markets. The sports betting giant launched their "Predictions" feature in December 2025, and it's already changing the game.

If you're a DraftKings user, you now have access to event contracts without leaving the platform. Here's how it works.

## What DraftKings Predictions Offers

DraftKings acquired Railbird, a prediction market exchange, and integrated it into their main platform. The result is seamless prediction market access for DraftKings users.

Available markets include:

- **Sports:** Game outcomes, player props, season predictions
- **Entertainment:** Award shows, TV show outcomes, celebrity events
- **Politics:** Election outcomes, policy decisions
- **Finance:** Fed decisions, economic indicators

Sports is clearly the focus. DraftKings knows their audience.

## How to Get Started

1. Open the DraftKings app or website
2. Navigate to the Predictions section
3. Browse available markets
4. Select Yes or No on any event
5. Enter your position size
6. Confirm the trade

If you've ever placed a sports bet on DraftKings, this will feel familiar. The interface is designed to be accessible to existing users.

## The Key Difference From Sports Betting

Prediction markets look like sports betting but work differently.

In traditional sports betting, you bet against the house. DraftKings sets the odds and takes the other side of your bet.

In prediction markets, you trade against other users. Prices are set by supply and demand. DraftKings just provides the platform and takes a small fee.

Why this matters: Prediction market prices reflect what actual people think will happen, not what a bookie calculated to maximize their profit.

## Pricing and Fees

DraftKings Predictions uses the same contract pricing as other platforms: $0.01 to $0.99 representing probability percentages.

Fees are minimal - a small percentage on winning trades. Competitive with Kalshi and better than most sportsbooks.

The real advantage is convenience. If you already have money in DraftKings, you can trade immediately without moving funds around.

## DraftKings vs Kalshi vs Polymarket

| Feature | DraftKings | Kalshi | Polymarket |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|
| Sports Markets | 5/5 | 4/5 | 2/5 |
| Political Markets | 3/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 |
| Ease of Use | 5/5 | 4/5 | 3/5 |
| Market Selection | 3/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 |

**Bottom line:** Use DraftKings if you're primarily interested in sports and want the simplest experience. Use Kalshi or Polymarket for deeper markets and more variety.

## Sports Trading Strategies

Since DraftKings is strongest on sports, here are strategies that work well there:

**Injury News Trading:** Sports prediction markets often lag behind injury news. If you learn about a key player injury before the market adjusts, you can profit.

**Season-Long Positions:** Take positions on outcomes months away (championship winners, MVP races) and adjust as the season progresses.

**Playoff Arbitrage:** During playoffs, prices can get irrational due to fan bias. Look for teams that are undervalued because they're not popular.

## Who Should Use DraftKings Predictions

This is a good fit if you:

- Already use DraftKings for sports betting
- Want to try prediction markets without opening new accounts
- Are primarily interested in sports markets
- Prefer a mobile-first, simple interface

Look elsewhere if you want deep political markets, crypto-related markets, or advanced trading tools.

## The Bigger Picture

DraftKings entering prediction markets is validation that this space is going mainstream.

They have millions of users, massive marketing budgets, and deep relationships with sports leagues. Their involvement brings prediction markets to audiences who've never heard of Kalshi or Polymarket.

For existing prediction market traders, this means more liquidity and more opportunities. For newcomers, it means an easy on-ramp through a platform you might already use.

Either way, prediction markets just got a lot more accessible.
