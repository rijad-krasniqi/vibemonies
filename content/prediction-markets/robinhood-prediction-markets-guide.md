If you already use Robinhood for stocks, you now have access to prediction markets. No new account needed. Same app. New opportunities.

Robinhood routes through Kalshi, the CFTC-regulated prediction market platform. So you're getting institutional-grade infrastructure with the interface you already know.

Here's everything you need to know to get started.

## How to Access Prediction Markets on Robinhood

It's shockingly simple:

1. Open your Robinhood app (make sure it's updated)
2. Look for the "Event Contracts" or "Predictions" section
3. Browse available markets
4. Trade

If you don't see it, you might need to enable it in settings or wait for rollout in your state. Robinhood is available in all 50 states, but some features roll out gradually.

## What You Can Trade

Robinhood offers a curated selection of Kalshi markets. Current categories include:

**Politics:** Election outcomes, policy decisions, appointment confirmations

**Economics:** Fed rate decisions, inflation numbers, GDP reports

**Sports:** Game outcomes, playoff scenarios, championship winners

**Entertainment:** Award show results, box office performance

The selection is more limited than what you'd get on Kalshi directly, but it covers the most popular markets.

## How Event Contracts Work

If you've traded stocks, event contracts will feel familiar but different.

Each contract is a yes/no question. "Will X happen?" You can buy Yes or No. Prices range from $0.01 to $0.99, representing the market's implied probability.

**Example:** "Will the Fed cut rates at the next meeting?" trades at $0.75.

If you buy Yes at $0.75 and the Fed does cut rates, you receive $1.00. Your profit is $0.25 per contract (minus fees).

If the Fed doesn't cut rates, your contract expires worthless. You lose the $0.75.

That's it. Binary outcome. Clear payout.

## The Robinhood Advantage

Why use Robinhood instead of going directly to Kalshi or Polymarket?

**One app for everything:** You can have stocks, crypto, and prediction markets all in one place. No need for multiple apps.

**Instant funding:** If you already have money in Robinhood, you can trade immediately. No waiting for bank transfers.

**Familiar interface:** If you know how to buy stocks on Robinhood, you already know how to trade event contracts.

**Regulatory protection:** Kalshi is CFTC-regulated. Your trades go through proper financial infrastructure.

## The Downsides

To be fair, there are tradeoffs:

**Limited selection:** Kalshi has way more markets than what shows up on Robinhood. If you want access to everything, you need a Kalshi account directly.

**Fees:** Robinhood charges $0.01 per contract. Small, but it adds up if you're trading frequently.

**No advanced tools:** You won't get the full orderbook view, historical data, or API access that power users want.

For beginners, Robinhood is perfect. For serious traders, you'll probably outgrow it.

## Beginner Strategies

If you're new to prediction markets, start simple:

**Trade what you know:** If you follow the Fed closely, trade Fed markets. If you watch sports, trade sports. Your knowledge is your edge.

**Small positions:** Start with $10-20 per trade. Learn how markets move before sizing up.

**Understand probability:** A $0.70 contract means the market thinks there's a 70% chance of Yes. If you think it's higher, buy. If lower, don't.

**Watch before trading:** Spend a week just observing how prices move. See how they react to news. Get a feel for the rhythm.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Treating it like gambling:** Prediction markets reward research and discipline, not luck. Approach them like investing, not like a casino.

**Ignoring the math:** Every trade has expected value. If the implied probability matches your estimate, the trade is neutral. You only make money when you're more right than the market.

**Overconfidence:** Markets aggregate the views of thousands of people. If you think you're smarter than everyone else, you're probably wrong.

**Chasing news:** By the time you see breaking news and open Robinhood, prices have already moved. You're usually too late.
