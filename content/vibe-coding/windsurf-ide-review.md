Windsurf is Codeium's answer to Cursor. It's a full IDE with AI baked in, not just an extension you bolt onto VS Code.

After using both for serious projects, I have opinions. Some of them might surprise you.

Here's the honest comparison.

## What Is Windsurf?

Windsurf is a standalone IDE built by Codeium, the company behind the popular Codeium autocomplete extension. They took everything they learned about AI-assisted coding and built it into a complete development environment.

Like Cursor, it's based on VS Code. Your extensions, themes, and keybindings work. But the AI integration goes deeper than any extension can.

The headline feature is "Cascade" - their agentic AI that can navigate your codebase, understand context across files, and make complex multi-file changes.

## First Impressions

Installing Windsurf takes about 3 minutes. It imported my VS Code settings automatically. Extensions worked. I was coding within 5 minutes.

The interface looks familiar if you've used VS Code. The AI panel sits on the right side. There's a chat interface for conversations and an inline mode for quick edits.

Speed impressed me immediately. Autocomplete suggestions appear fast. The AI panel loads quickly. It doesn't feel sluggish like some AI tools do.

## The Cascade Feature

This is what sets Windsurf apart. Cascade is an "agentic" AI assistant that can:

- Read multiple files to understand context
- Make changes across your entire codebase
- Execute terminal commands
- Search and navigate your project
- Remember context from earlier in your session

In practice, you can ask things like:

> "Find all the places where we handle user authentication and add logging to each one."

Cascade will search your codebase, identify the relevant files, and make the changes. It shows you what it's doing step by step, and you can approve or reject changes.

This is fundamentally different from basic AI autocomplete. It's closer to having a junior developer you can delegate to.

## Windsurf vs Cursor: Feature Comparison

| Feature | Windsurf | Cursor |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Base editor | VS Code fork | VS Code fork |
| Autocomplete | Fast, context-aware | Fast, context-aware |
| Chat interface | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-file editing | Yes (Cascade) | Yes (Composer) |
| Terminal integration | Yes | Yes |
| Image understanding | Yes | Yes |
| Custom model support | Limited | More options |
| Codebase indexing | Automatic | Automatic |

On paper, they're similar. The differences are in execution.

## Where Windsurf Wins

**Autocomplete speed**: Windsurf's suggestions appear faster. For pure typing flow, it feels smoother. The latency difference is small but noticeable during long coding sessions.

**Free tier**: Windsurf's free tier is more generous. You get meaningful AI usage without paying. Cursor's free tier is more limited.

**Cascade understanding**: For navigating unfamiliar codebases, Cascade impressed me. It grasped project structure quickly and made sensible suggestions about where changes should go.

**Resource usage**: Windsurf felt lighter on my machine. Less memory usage, fewer fans spinning up. This matters for laptop users.

**Learning curve**: If you're coming from basic autocomplete tools, Windsurf feels more approachable. The UI guides you more.

## Where Cursor Wins

**Model flexibility**: Cursor gives you more control over which AI models to use. You can choose Claude, GPT-4, and others. Windsurf is more locked to Codeium's own models.

**Composer mode**: Cursor's Composer for multi-file editing feels more mature. It's been refined over more time and handles complex refactors slightly better.

**Community and documentation**: Cursor has a larger user base. More tutorials, more community solutions, more people to ask for help.

**Advanced features**: Features like Cursor Tab (accepting suggestions mid-line) and the keyboard-centric workflow feel more polished.

**Integration with Claude**: If you're already in the Anthropic ecosystem with Claude Code, Cursor integrates more naturally.

## Real-World Test: Building a Feature

I tested both on the same task: adding a comments feature to an existing blog application.

**With Cursor:**
- Used Composer to outline the changes needed
- It identified the right files quickly
- Made backend and frontend changes
- Had to manually fix one import issue
- Total time: about 25 minutes

**With Windsurf:**
- Used Cascade to analyze the codebase
- It asked clarifying questions about the database schema
- Made similar changes with slightly different structure
- Worked first try without manual fixes
- Total time: about 20 minutes

Both got the job done. Windsurf was slightly faster, Cursor gave me more control over the implementation details.

## Pricing Breakdown

**Windsurf:**
- Free tier: Generous limits for hobbyists
- Pro: $15/month for unlimited AI features
- Team plans available

**Cursor:**
- Free tier: Limited AI usage
- Pro: $20/month
- Business: $40/month

Windsurf is cheaper and has a better free tier. For individual developers on a budget, this matters.

## Who Should Use Windsurf?

**Choose Windsurf if:**

- You want the best free tier for AI coding
- Speed and low latency matter to you
- You're new to AI-assisted development
- You don't need specific model choices
- You're on a limited machine (laptop, older hardware)

**Choose Cursor if:**

- You want maximum control over AI models
- You're already invested in the Cursor ecosystem
- You need advanced features like Cursor Tab
- You value community size and resources
- You want tighter Claude/Anthropic integration

## The Elephant in the Room

Both tools are improving rapidly. What I'm writing today might be outdated in months.

Windsurf is the newer competitor, aggressively catching up. Cursor is the established leader, trying to stay ahead. Competition is making both better.

The real question isn't which is objectively better. It's which fits your workflow right now.

## My Recommendation

For most people new to AI-assisted coding, I'd suggest trying Windsurf first.

The free tier lets you actually evaluate it. The learning curve is gentler. If it does what you need, you'll save money compared to Cursor.

If you hit limitations - maybe you want specific models, or advanced features, or you find the Cursor community more helpful - then switch. Both use VS Code as the base, so migration is easy.

For developers already productive with Cursor, I don't see a compelling reason to switch. The benefits of Windsurf aren't dramatic enough to justify relearning a tool.

## Setting Up Windsurf for Success

If you're trying Windsurf, here's how to get started right:

1. **Import VS Code settings**: When prompted, import everything. Your muscle memory works immediately.

2. **Enable Cascade**: Don't skip the Cascade tour. Understanding how it works changes how you interact with the tool.

3. **Customize the AI panel**: Right-click the panel to adjust its size and position. I prefer it larger than the default.

4. **Learn the keyboard shortcuts**: Cmd+K (or Ctrl+K) for inline editing, Cmd+L for the chat panel. These become second nature.

5. **Set up your .windsurfrules file**: Like CLAUDE.md for Claude Code, this file tells Windsurf about your project conventions.

## The Verdict

Windsurf is legitimate. It's not a cheap clone or a marketing exercise. It's a serious alternative to Cursor that does some things better.

Is it better than Cursor? For some people, yes. For others, no. The right answer depends on your priorities.

The good news: you can try both for free. Spend a day with each on a real project. Your experience will tell you more than any review.

The AI coding tool landscape is evolving fast. Whatever you choose today, stay flexible. The best tool next year might not exist yet.
